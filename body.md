# Abstract

The use of open source software for research in Brazil is small
and we want to change this by training national Python and R champions
as Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors
so that they can lower the barrier to other researchers start using
open source sotware as their go-to option.

# Project Description

Software Carpentry activities started in Brazil in 2014 by Raniere Silva
who organised some workshops with the help of collegues.
The barriers, so far, for Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
increase the number of workshops runn in Brazil for a few per year
to a couple of dozen are the small number of instructors,
the small number of conferences, such as PyData, where contributors could interact,
and the lessons not be available in Portuguses.
This project aims to work to reduce the three barriers described before
by providing support to one idea
that Melissa Mendonça, Filipe Fernandes, and other attendees of SciPy Latin America 2016 had,
create a Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanograph.

## Instructor Training Event

Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's Instructor Training will be offered
up to 20 new instructors. The event two-days event will be hosted in Florianópolis, Brazil
so that Melissa Mendonça, Juliana Leonel and their collaborators could be trained.
We will invited members of the local PyLadies group to be trained.
Since Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry don't have any Instructor Trainer Trainer
who speak Portuguese, this workshop will be offered in English.
And because of the limited number of seats we will select participants after an open round of applications based on the successful case of Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's Instructor Training in South Africa in 2016.

## Lessons in Portuguese

Following the Instructor Training event,
a three-days lesson translation to Portuguese sprint will take place also in Florianópolis.
The sprint will provide a opportunity for Instructor Training attendees
work on their final assignment
and get more knowledge of how Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry operate.
We expected that at the end of the sprint at least four lessons have being translated: Shell, OpenRefine, Python, and R. Software Carpentry's Git lesson was translated into Portuguese by Raniere in 2015.

## Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanograph

During the three-days lesson translation sprint,
Melissa Mendonça, Juliana Leonel, Filipe Fernadeds and others
will work on a Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanograph.
This lesson will be first developed in Portuguese
since we aim to use it right after the sprint.
In the future,
Data Carpentry should be able to work to clean
the English translation provided by a automatic translation tool.

## First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering

Aleksandra Pawlik will organise the First Brazilian Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshop for Women in Science and Engineering
based on her experience organising a similar event on the UK.
Instructors for this workshop are not defined yet
but we will invite new instructors who attended the Instructor Training event
to teach one module or be helpers.

## Softare Carpentry and Data Carpentry Workshops

The Data Carpentry Lesson for Oceanograph will be tested
by Melissa Mendonça and Juliana Leonel in Florianópolis.
We are looking for partners in other Brazilian cities
interested to host a Software Carpentry or Data Carpentry workshop
in the weeks following the lesson translation sprint.

# Benefit to Project and Community

With this project we will
increase the number of Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry instructors in Brazil,
translate some of the Software Carpentry's and Data Carpentry's lesson to Portuguese,
train at least 40 Brazilian researchers in free and open source tools
they can use on their work.
A long term benefit of this proposal is that Brazilian universities and research centers
will be interested in Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry
and become partners making interventions such as this one unecessary.
A complimentary benefit is that we will increase the number of users of other NumFOCUS sponsored and affiliates projects.
